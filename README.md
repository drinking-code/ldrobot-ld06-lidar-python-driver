# Basic Driver for the LD06 LiDAR Sensor
This repository provides a basic (currently read-only) driver for LDROBOT's LD06 LiDAR sensor.  
This code was largely adopted from [henjin0's repository](https://github.com/henjin0/LIDAR_LD06_python_loder).

> ⚠️ THE CODE IS CURRENTLY NOT TESTED TO WORK WHATSOEVER ⚠️
